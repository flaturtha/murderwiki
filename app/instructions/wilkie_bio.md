## Early Life

Wilkie Collins was born in Marylebone, London, to William Collins, a successful landscape painter and member of the Royal Academy, and Harriet Geddes. Named after his father, he was known as "Wilkie" to distinguish him from his namesake. In 1826, the Collins family moved to Hampstead, where young Wilkie developed an interest in storytelling and drama.

Collins received his early education at private schools and later attended Maida Hill Academy. His early career path was uncertain; his father encouraged him to pursue business, leading to his apprenticeship with a tea merchant. However, Wilkie’s creative inclinations drew him toward literature.

## Career Beginnings

In 1844, Collins’s family traveled to Italy, where he was exposed to art, culture, and history, experiences that later influenced his writing. Returning to London, he studied law at Lincoln’s Inn, though he showed little interest in practicing. In 1848, Collins published his first work, *Memoirs of the Life of William Collins, Esq., R.A.*, a biography of his father.

His first novel, *Antonina; or, The Fall of Rome* (1850), set during the Roman Empire, displayed his interest in historical fiction. However, it was not until the 1850s, after meeting Charles Dickens, that Collins’s career gained momentum. Dickens became a mentor, publishing Collins’s works in his magazine *Household Words*.

## Personal Life

Collins’s personal life was unconventional by Victorian standards. He never married but maintained relationships with two women simultaneously: Caroline Graves, with whom he lived, and Martha Rudd, with whom he had three children. His relationships and views on marriage influenced his writings, particularly his critiques of societal norms.

Collins suffered from various health issues, including gout, which led to his reliance on laudanum, a form of opium. This dependency affected both his personal life and his later works, which often lacked the vigor of his earlier successes.

## Later Years and Legacy

Today, Collins is celebrated as a master of the sensation novel and a pioneer of the modern detective story. His works have inspired countless adaptations in film, television, and theater, ensuring his legacy endures.
